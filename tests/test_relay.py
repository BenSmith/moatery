"""egress_relay.relay: both directions at once, over plain sockets and TLS.

The relay sits between two peers that each may write before they read.
An origin that answers before it has read the upload -- a 401 or 413
during a large POST, a WebSocket, a bidirectional h2 stream -- waits on
its write while the guest waits on its own, and a relay that blocks in
one direction's write never reads the other: all three stall until the
idle timeout ends the connection. Each exchange here is sized past what
the socket buffers absorb, which is what makes the stall reachable.
