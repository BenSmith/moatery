"""Test-package bootstrap: puts the code under test on sys.path.

Test modules are imported as ``tests.<name>``, so this runs before any of them
and is the one place that knows the checkout layout.

Shipped code is the ``customs`` package. Installed, it is in
site-packages; from a checkout the checkout root goes on the path.
``tests/`` itself goes on the path too, so sibling helpers (e.g.
``covhelper``) import by bare name. The entrypoints under ``libexec/``
have no ``.py`` extension and so cannot be imported by name -- use
:func:`load_script`. Subprocess launches of those scripts need the same
path handed down in the child env -- use :func:`script_env`.

# PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE, but only the export reaches the subprocesses, which
# is the half that matters: this suite mutation-tests customs/ deliberately
# (perturb a file, run, restore it inside the same second), and a child that
# writes a .pyc during a perturbation window records the original mtime, which
# a later import then trusts and executes as stale bytecode -- a false failure
# that reads as a real one (a tar that exits 2 for no reason). -B alone cannot
# fix it: sys.dont_write_bytecode is per-interpreter and is not inherited. So
# this package pins both, for the parent (in case it was started without -B)

    Overrides are stringified, so callers can pass Paths and ints directly.

    NO_COLOR is forced on, and it is not cosmetic. Python 3.14's argparse
    colourises its own help, and it decides that from the ENVIRONMENT
    (FORCE_COLOR) as well as from isatty -- so a developer or runner with
    FORCE_COLOR set gets ANSI escapes on a captured pipe, where every earlier
    Python emitted plain text. A test that reads a line out of `--help` then
    sees a line beginning with an escape sequence rather than the verb, and
    fails somewhere unrelated to what it was checking. That is what happened to
    test_cli_docs's `egress` check the first time this suite ran in an
    environment with FORCE_COLOR=3.

    Set centrally rather than per test because the property wanted is not
    "this test does not want colour" but "our scripts' output is parsed by
    machine here", which is true of every caller. NO_COLOR wins over
    FORCE_COLOR in CPython's resolution, so this holds regardless of what the
    ambient environment asked for, and an override still wins over both for a
    test that genuinely wants to see colour.
