"""customs-inspect: the terminated TLS plane.

A spliced connection reads a name and replays the guest's own bytes. This
plane TERMINATES -- the listener completes the guest's handshake with a leaf
its own CA signed, opens a separately verified session to the origin, and
authorises every request inside.

WHY THESE TESTS ARE END TO END AND NOT ARGV ASSERTIONS

Every interesting failure on this path is invisible to a test that inspects
arguments. A leaf whose subjectAltName is not marked critical builds a perfect
argv and is then refused by every client. A wrap_socket that consumes the
ClientHello leaves the handshake to hang. A trust store that is loaded but not
consulted looks identical to one that is. So each of these drives a REAL client
against a REAL origin through the real listener: the assertion is on bytes that
came back, and the parts that cannot be true at once fail loudly.

THE ORIGIN IS A SECOND CA, ON PURPOSE

The workload CA signs what the guest sees; a separate throwaway root signs what
the ORIGIN presents. Sharing one would make the upstream verification test pass
for the wrong reason -- the inspector would be verifying a certificate its own
CA signed, which is exactly the check that must not accidentally hold.
