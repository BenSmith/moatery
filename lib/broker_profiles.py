"""What the shipped broker makes of its command line at startup.

The refusals and the per-Host profile table: `build_profiles` resolves each
`--host HOST=CREDENTIAL` against the material that credential id names and
the `--placeholder`/`--auth-header`/`--auth-format` flags that describe it,
and `normalise_host` is the one spelling of a `Host` the table is keyed by
and the server looks up. The generator side -- how broker_config spells the
flags this reads -- and this reader are pinned against each other by
tests/test_broker_closure.py, because a flag emitted at one end and not
taken at the other is a broker that refuses to start, which for a generated
unit is a restart loop.

THERE IS NO DOCUMENT. The broker took a broker.toml until the flags: a file
workload-broker-config rendered into the unit's RuntimeDirectory at every
start, from the workload TOML, as the unit's DynamicUser. Every value in it
was a pure function of the workload TOML and the uid -- which is exactly
what the generator holds when it writes the unit -- so the file was a second
rendering of facts the ExecStart= line could carry itself, plus a TOML
reader, a key vocabulary, a writer, an ExecStartPre and a RuntimeDirectory=
to keep the two in step. The property the file was chosen for (never serving
a previous boot's credential set) was never the file's: it holds no
material, and LoadCredentialEncrypted= decrypts the material afresh at every
start with or without it.
