"""The per-workload egress CA, the leaves it signs, and where all of it lives.

One CA per workload rather than one per host, and the directory names, the
validity windows, the SELinux types of the subtree and the two openssl
invocations are all here together because they are one decision each spelled
in several places: the minter creates the directories, the SELinux patterns
label them (workload_selinux.pki_fcontext_patterns composes the names here
with the workload's root), `diagnose` reads the certificate back, and the
seed writes the anchor into the guest (vm_default_seed.vm_ca_env decides
which guest gets one). A drift between any two of those is a mislabelled
directory or an untrusted anchor, and both present as a network fault rather
than as a naming mistake.

Both substrates, despite the `vm_`/`VM_` prefixes -- the container half mints
against the same CA through the same minter.

On the listener's side of the line: this module takes a STATE DIRECTORY and
knows nothing about which workload it belongs to or how workloadctl found it.
It imports inspect_document and nothing above it, so the inspector's closure
stays free of the config grammar. Nothing here runs openssl or touches the
filesystem; it builds paths and argv, and lib/egress_mint.py is what executes
them.

Installed to /usr/libexec/workloadctl/egress_ca.py.
