"""The per-workload egress CA, the leaves it signs, and where all of it lives.

One CA per workload rather than one per host, and the directory names, the
validity windows and the two openssl invocations are all here together
because they are one decision each spelled in several places: the minter
creates the directories, whoever labels the state directory composes the
names here, and whoever reports on a workload reads the certificate back.
A drift between any two of those is a mislabelled directory or an
untrusted anchor, and both present as a network fault rather than as a
naming mistake. Where the anchor goes inside the workload, and what a
label is called, are whoever provisions the workload's to decide.

This module takes a STATE DIRECTORY and knows nothing about which workload
it belongs to or how the caller found it. It imports inspect_document and
nothing above it. Nothing here runs openssl or touches the filesystem; it
builds paths and argv, and lib/egress_mint.py is what executes them.

# One CA per workload, generated like the SSH host keypair: idempotent, made

#
# Per-workload scoping is what makes the key affordable. It lives in the
# workload's state directory, owned by the uid the workload runs as, and the
# only party trusting it is the workload that uid already owns, so an escape
# stealing it gains the ability to impersonate sites TO ITSELF. A single
# host-wide CA shared by every workload would be a genuine crown jewel.

# calls healthy, for a date nobody wrote down.

# Distance is not the same as invisibility: the certificate carries
