"""The egress inspector's record: what it refuses, what it writes, and the
file it writes to.

The vocabulary of one refusal (`DROP_*`, `DROP_REASONS`, the per-host subset),
the shape of one line of the per-request record (`RECORD_FIELDS` and the
closed sets three of its fields draw from), and the writer (`Record`,
`RequestLog`). Defined once, here, and read by everything on both sides of
the file: the listener writes it, `workloadctl egress` renders and filters
it, `diagnose` reads the counters keyed by the same strings.

Defined once because a writer and a reader that each spell the vocabulary
can drift, and a drift turns a real refusal into a figure that reads zero --
indistinguishable from a refusal that never fired. One definition both sides
import needs no pin test to hold it together.

Where the record file lives (`INSPECT_RECORD_ROOT`, `inspect_record_path`)
stays in egress_policy beside the rest of the inspector's paths.

# The reasons that also get a PER-HOST figure, and the only ones that do.
#
# Each is a refusal an operator acts on by NAME: the host to add an
# [[vm.network.internal]] entry for, the host whose private root has to go into
# this host's anchors, the host that needs client certificates and therefore
# `tls = "splice"`, and the host that is not speaking HTTP and therefore needs
# the same. `not HTTP/2` joins them and is read the same way with one word
# changed: the operator put that host in [[vm.network.http2]] and it did not
# speak h2, so either the entry is wrong or the host needs splicing.
#
# `not HTTP` appears TWICE, and the split is the whole value of the pair. The
# figures answer two different questions -- which hosts want splicing, and
# which hosts have method and path rules that can never run. The second has no
# other way of being learnt: nothing at startup could have told the operator,
# because whether a host speaks HTTP is not knowable from the file, which is
# exactly why §8 made it a runtime report rather than a validation rule.
#
# A per-host figure for `not allowlisted` is deliberately absent --
# the guest picks those names, there is no bound on how many it invents, and
# the answer is already the allowlist itself rather than a list to read. The
# un-allowlisted half of the binding rejection is absent for the same reason
# and the ALLOWLISTED half is present for its inverse: those names came off
# this workload's own lists, so the key space is bounded by the file, and WHICH
# PAIR of names a client is coalescing is the entire question that figure
# answers. A count alone says a mismatch happened; §4 needs to know between
# what.
#
# `not permitted by policy` is absent too, and unlike the two above that is a
# decision rather than a consequence. Its keys look bounded by the file -- a
# `policy` entry allowlists its own host -- but a WILDCARD entry bounds nothing,
# and a guest under `*.example.com` invents subdomains as freely as it invents
# anything else. That alone would settle it. What settles it twice is that the
# figure would not help if it were free: an operator whose request was refused
# needs the METHOD and the PATH to know which of their `methods`/`paths` lines
# to change, and a per-host count carries neither. That question belongs to the
# per-request record, which has all three, and half-answering it here would put
# the more findable of the two answers in the operator's way.
#
# Every one of these is a BOUNDED top-N with a counted overflow, because the
# keys are guest-chosen: unbounded, a guest inflating the report damages the
# host's Prometheus label cardinality rather than its own workload.

# false definition of "what this request touched" into the one document that
