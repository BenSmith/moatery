"""
http_framing: where one HTTP/1.1 message ends and the next begins, by refusal.

Everything here answers one question for the inspect listener's cleartext and
terminated planes: given bytes a GUEST wrote, where does this message end, so
the next one can be authorised on its own. The framing that says where a
request ends is written by the guest, and every refusal here exists because
the alternative is a request smuggled past the authorisation of the one in
front of it. Where two parsers could read a message two ways, nothing here
picks one: it raises RequestUnreadable and the listener declines the message.

The request parser (`_split_head`) is strict for that reason. The response
parser (`_split_response_head`) is lenient for the opposite one: that head was
written by an origin the policy authorised and is relayed verbatim, so the
only thing to learn from it is where the body ends.

Not here: what the request target means (`http_target`), what a whole
request looks like once parsed (`http_request`), and the HTTP/2 check
(`h2_framing`), which is framing too, of the shallowest kind.
