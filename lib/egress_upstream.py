"""egress_upstream: the leg from the inspector to the name the policy named.

Every upstream connection either plane opens goes through here: the plain
dial the cleartext plane makes, the verified TLS session the terminated plane
opens to an origin, and the loopback hop to this workload's own credential
broker. `Upstream` holds the two verifying contexts and the pool that reuses
a connection across the requests of one guest connection; the module
functions name a failed leg -- which drop reason it is, and the one sentence
a guest may be told.

Dialled by NAME, never by the address the guest aimed at (the inspector
design, §7.4): that address is this inspector's own listener, so resolving
the authorised name here is what makes the destination the one the policy
named rather than one the guest chose.

        `dial` is what OPENS one, and it is the whole of the difference between
        the two planes here: cleartext dials port 80, the terminated plane dials
        443 and verifies. A redial is a real possibility on both -- an origin
        that answers `Connection: close`, an HTTP/1.0 exchange -- so the
        terminated plane passes the same verifying dial it used at the front of
        the connection rather than a socket it captured once.

        Dialled by NAME (§7.4), like the TLS plane: the address the guest aimed
        at is this inspector's own listener, so resolving the authorised name
        here is what makes the destination the one the policy named.

        Bounded at UPSTREAMS_MAX and evicted least-recently-used, because the
        set of names is the guest's to choose: a wildcard pattern makes every
        distinct subdomain a new socket, and the map outlives the request that
        opened it. Eviction is not a refusal -- the evicted name is redialled
        if it comes back -- so the bound costs a round trip in the pathological
        case and nothing at all in the honest one. `upstreams` is an ordinary
        dict, which preserves insertion order, and a hit reinserts to move the

        `reusable=False` opts one exchange out of the map entirely -- see the
        branch below for which requests do that and why. The stream is still
        returned; it is simply the caller's to close.

        `key` SEPARATES THE POOL SLOT FROM THE NAME DIALLED, because with a

        go to two different places, and the origin one is already in this map

    Two failures arrive as the same OSError. A name that resolves into
    private space with no [[vm.network.internal]] entry -- `internal` is the
    policy's set of the names that have one -- was refused by the
    kernel's internal drop -- the wildcard trap firing, and an operator one
    line from a working config. A name that resolves anywhere else, or that
    has an entry already, is a host that is down.

    This RE-RESOLVES the name rather than reading the address the failed
    dial used, because create_connection does not report which address it
    tried. The re-resolution can disagree with the first under a rotating
    record, and the cost of that is a misattributed counter rather than a
    wrong decision: nothing here admits or refuses anything. The decision
    was already taken, by the kernel, on the address that was actually
    dialled.

    Anything unexpected degrades to the generic reason. A counter is not
    worth failing a connection over, and this runs on a path that has
    already failed.

    THE COST, STATED

    getaddrinfo blocks and CONNECTION_TIMEOUT does not bound it -- that
    timeout is set on the socket, and this is a resolver call. So a failed
    dial to an allowlisted-but-down host costs a second synchronous
    lookup while still holding its slot against the ceiling, and a guest can
    provoke that at will by dialling such a host repeatedly. Bounded, not
    free: MAX_CONNECTIONS caps how many can be in this state at once, and
    the host-side resolver is the same one the first dial already used, so
    the answer is normally cached. Accepted because the alternative --
    attributing without resolving -- means create_connection reporting
    which address it tried, which it does not.
