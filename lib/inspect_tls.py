"""
inspect_tls: the TLS plane -- peek, match, then splice or terminate.

A connection on 443 has its ClientHello read and its server name matched
against this workload's `hosts`. What happens next is the mode the policy
names, and every decision is made against the workload's Inspection
(lib/inspect_scope.py), which every function here takes first.

TWO TLS MODES

`tls = "splice"` decrypts nothing: the hello is peeked for its name and then
relayed from the socket, byte for byte, with everything after it.

`tls = "inspect"` (the default) TERMINATES. The same peek takes the same
decision, and then this process completes the guest's handshake itself with a
leaf minted by the workload's own CA, opens a separately verified session to
the origin, and authorises every REQUEST inside on the same matcher the
cleartext plane uses. The allowlist means the same thing on both planes only
under termination: spliced, a name is checked once at the front of a connection
whose contents nothing can see.

The reader itself is `lib/tls_hello.py`.

BUMP-THEN-ANSWER

Every refusal a terminated connection carries is delivered THROUGH a completed
handshake, denials included: mint, complete the guest's handshake, then answer
403 or 502 in plain HTTP. Failing the handshake instead gives the guest an
opaque certificate error indistinguishable from the host being down. The
answer is the status and its phrase alone; the reason is the operator's, and
goes to the journal.

    THE ORDER IS THE DESIGN. The upstream leg is established BEFORE the

    learn what to say upstream -- the protocol offered on both legs comes
    from UPSTREAM_ALPN, which is configuration. And the mint comes after the
    dial, so a host that cannot be reached or cannot be verified costs a
    leaf only because the REFUSAL is delivered through one.

    A BROKERED HOST HAS NO LEG TO ESTABLISH, and that does not weaken the
    invariant: the offer is still configuration, it is just always
    `http/1.1`. The request goes to this workload's broker, which is dialled
    per request, so an origin connection opened here would be verified and
    never written to -- and would make the ORIGIN's reachability and
    certificate a prerequisite for a request that never reaches it. See the
    branch below.

    EVERY OUTCOME IS BUMPED, denials included. A guest told "no" by a failed
    handshake is told nothing it can distinguish from the host being down;
    told "no" by a 403 or 502 through a chain it trusts, it knows it was

    session we completed, so a close here is a close it can see and cannot

    THE COST IS REAL AND THIS LINE IS THE ONLY EVIDENCE. A host that

    keeps end-to-end TLS while every other name on the workload stays
    inspected. Whole-workload `"tls": "splice"` gives up far more than the
    one host asked for.

    AND THE TWO REFUSALS ARE COUNTED APART. A host a `policy` entry names
    is the same wire failure with a different remedy: the entry's `methods`
    and `paths` never ran and never can, so splicing the host is only half
    of it -- the entry has to go too, because load_policy refuses a host
