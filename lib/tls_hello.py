"""
Reading a server name out of a TLS ClientHello, and no more.

Enough of RFC 8446 §4.1.2 to read the server name and see which extensions are
present. It is not a TLS implementation and must not become one: every field
it does not need is skipped by its length, so an extension shape it has never
seen costs it nothing.

The hello is PEEKED, never consumed. A terminated connection's hello must
still be on the socket for ssl's wrap_socket, and a spliced one is relayed
from the socket unchanged, so neither path wants the bytes taken off it. A
peek is bounded by the receive buffer, which CLIENTHELLO_MAX sits well
inside.

# the socket readable and the peek returns that same part at once. A hello
# larger than one segment -- the default post-quantum hello is, at 1500 MTU
# -- is routinely caught between its segments, so no progress means "wait",
# not "refuse". The whole read is bounded by the socket's own timeout, taken
# once for the hello rather than per read, so a dribbling peer holds its
