"""Recovering the listeners a .socket unit passed in.

Shared by the two programs that are socket-activated and never bind:
`libexec/workload-inspect-listener` and `libexec/workload-vm-resolve`.
Both take their sockets from systemd and refuse to open one of their own --
but for different reasons, which is why `refusal` is a parameter rather than
a sentence written here. The listener's bind must stay in the inherited fd to
keep it out of the workload SELinux domain; the resolver's port 53 is
privileged and the process is not. An operator who hits this needs the reason
that applies to the program they are looking at, so each supplies its own.

Only the *reason* differs. Reading LISTEN_PID/LISTEN_FDS, refusing an
activation environment that belongs to another process, and turning the fd
range into sockets are identical in both, and are here.
