"""What leaves this host carrying a credential, decided without a socket.

The broker's request path as free functions: which of a caller's headers go
upstream and which are replaced, how a request is framed before any of it is
forwarded, and how an upstream response is re-framed on the way back. None
of it needs a connection to be decided, and as free functions none of it
needs a server with a TLS upstream to be tested -- which, as methods on the
handler, is what it would take, and how a whole request path goes untested
while config and identity are covered three ways.
