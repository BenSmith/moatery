"""What leaves this host carrying a credential, decided without a socket.

The broker's request path as free functions: which of a caller's headers go
upstream and which are replaced, how a request is framed before any of it is
forwarded, and how an upstream response is re-framed on the way back. None
of it needs a connection to be decided, and as methods on the handler it was
reachable only by standing up a server with a TLS upstream -- which is how
the whole request path goes untested while config and identity are covered
three ways.

Used by `libexec/agent-broker`. Installed to /usr/libexec/workloadctl/broker_request.py.
