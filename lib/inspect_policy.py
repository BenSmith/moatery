"""The inspector's policy document, as the listener holds it.

`load_policy` reads the JSON document and returns a `Policy`: one
workload's inspection lists, read once at start and never edited after, so
that an edited document applies on a restart and the running policy is
always the file's. The questions the listener asks of it -- does this host
get through, is it spliced, is it h2, which policy entry governs it -- are
answered with the same hostname rule and the same entry matcher the render
side uses, both imported from inspect_document so the two cannot diverge.

The renderer is egress_policy, and this module does not import it: the
document is the whole interface, and a reader that imported its writer
would drag the config grammar into the listener's closure. What is shared
lives one rung below both, in inspect_document.
