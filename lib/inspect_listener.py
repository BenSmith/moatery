"""
inspect_listener: the transparent egress inspector (the inspector design,
§7.7.1), one connection at a time.

The shape is the socket, the concurrency and the timeout discipline: accept
on the inherited listeners, admit up to a ceiling, name the plane, and hand
the connection to it with the workload's Inspection (lib/inspect_scope.py).
The planes are the rest. On 443 (lib/inspect_tls.py) a connection has its
ClientHello read, its server name matched against this workload's `hosts`,
and is then SPLICED byte-exact to that name's real host, TERMINATED and
authorised request by request, or closed. On 80 (lib/inspect_http.py) every
request on a connection is authorised by its Host header, through the same
matcher, and only the ones that pass are relayed -- a name on no list gets a
real 403 naming it, which is an answer 443 cannot give.

WHY THE PLANE COMES FROM getsockname, NOT LISTEN_FDNAMES

The socket unit runs with Accept=no, under which systemd names every
activated fd after the unit — all four carry the same LISTEN_FDNAMES entry, so
the name cannot tell the cleartext listener from the TLS one. The local port
of the inherited fd can, and it is the honest source of it: a guest dial to 80
is translated onto the cleartext plane's inspect port, one to 443 onto the
TLS plane's (lib/egress_plane.py), and the socket that accepted the
connection knows which it is. §7.1 uses exactly this property to justify never calling
SO_ORIGINAL_DST; a regression that started reading the port from anywhere
else quietly reintroduces the need for it.

CONCURRENCY AND TIMEOUTS (the shape, per §7.7.1)

One thread per connection, with a ceiling, and reject above it — do not queue.
An unbounded accept queue turns a guest's connection storm into memory growth
in a process that holds a CA key; a refused connection is a fast,
countable failure instead. The threads are daemons, as the broker's
ThreadingMixIn sets them, so a SIGTERM that stops the accept loop does not
wait on the connections it already took.

Every accepted socket gets an explicit timeout before it is touched, and the
two numbers it moves between -- one bounding every wait up to a decision, one
bounding every wait after -- are egress_relay's, which says why they cannot
be one number and which wait on the cleartext plane takes which.
