"""The broker's server: one handler thread per admitted connection.

Handler settles the caller's identity once per connection, looks the
request's Host up in the profile table, and forwards one buffered request at a time to
the fixed upstream with the credential attached -- the decisions themselves
are broker_request's. Server bounds the pool: a global ceiling, a per-caller
ceiling, and an in-flight body budget, each refusing fast rather than
queueing, because a sandbox that can make the broker hang can deny it to
every other sandbox. The two TLS contexts at the end are the program's:
verified TLS out to the provider, and optional TLS in from the guest.

Used by `libexec/agent-broker`. Installed to /usr/libexec/workloadctl/broker_server.py.
