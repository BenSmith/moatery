"""Who owns the far end of an accepted connection?

Shared by `libexec/customs-broker` and `libexec/customs-inspect`, which
both need to answer the same question about a caller and have no business
answering it two ways. The userns helpers at the end are the precondition for
the answer being truthful: the kernel translates a uid through the reader's
namespace, so a process that cannot map a workload's uid sees the overflow
uid instead and every such caller collapses into one identity.

TWO FAMILIES, ONE QUESTION. On a listener bound to a path, SO_PEERCRED is
the answer: the credentials the kernel recorded at connect(), read off the
socket. On a listener bound to an address SO_PEERCRED yields nothing usable
-- it is AF_UNIX-only -- so the check goes to the kernel's socket table
instead, finding the peer's row in /proc/net and reading its owner. Neither
is a handshake: the owner is recorded by the kernel and there is nothing for
a caller to participate in or lie about.

WHY THE UID AND NOT THE ADDRESS. The host's networking re-originates every
workload flow -- passt for a VM, pasta for a container -- as a host socket
owned by that workload's own user. The source address is therefore identical
for all of them and carries no information; the uid is assigned by the host, is
unreachable from inside the workload, and is the same primitive the host's
egress rules already match on.
