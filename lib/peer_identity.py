"""Who owns the far end of an accepted TCP connection?

Shared by `libexec/agent-broker` and `libexec/workload-inspect-listener`,
which both need to answer the same question about a caller and had no business
answering it two ways. The userns helpers at the end are the precondition for
the answer being truthful: /proc/net translates the uid column through the
reader's namespace, so a process that cannot map a workload's uid sees the
overflow uid instead and every such caller collapses into one identity.

WHY NOT SO_PEERCRED. It is AF_UNIX-only. On a TCP socket it yields nothing
usable, so a peer-credential check on a listener bound to an address has to go
to the kernel's socket table instead. That is still not a handshake: the owner
is recorded by the kernel and read out of /proc/net, so there is nothing for a
caller to participate in or lie about.

WHY THE UID AND NOT THE ADDRESS. The host's networking re-originates every
workload flow -- passt for a VM, pasta for a container -- as a host socket owned
by that workload's own user. The source address is therefore identical for all
of them and carries no information; the uid is assigned by the host, is
unreachable from inside the workload, and is the same primitive the host's
egress rules already match on.
