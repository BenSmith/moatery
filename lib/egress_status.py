"""The counters a filtered VM's two long-running processes emit, and the files
they emit them into.

WHY THIS IS A SHARED MODULE AND NOT PART OF EITHER PROCESS

The inspector (`workload-inspect-listener`) and the synthesising responder
(`workload-vm-resolve`) are separate socket-activated services with separate
lifetimes: a guest that resolves a name and never dials it runs one of them and
not the other. They both have figures to report, and both need the same two
things -- a per-host map that a guest cannot grow without limit, and a status
file replaced atomically. Writing that twice is how the two halves of one report
end up with two definitions of "bounded".

WHY TWO FILES

§11 names one file, `inspect-status.json`, "carrying every counter above". Taken
literally that is two processes atomically replacing one path, and `os.replace`
has exactly one winner: whichever wrote last, with the other's figures gone. The
failure is silent and looks like a counter that does not move.

So each producer writes its own file and rung 5's reader merges them:

    /run/workload-vm/<name>/inspect-status.json   the listener's
    /run/workload-vm/<name>/resolve-status.json   the responder's

This keeps the property §11 actually asked for -- "one producer and no second
definition of any figure" -- rather than the filename it asked for it in. It
also makes the DNS figures readable on a workload whose guest has dialled
nothing, which the single-file arrangement could not do: the listener would not
have run to write them.

THE BOUND, AND WHAT IT HONESTLY IS

Every per-host figure is keyed on a string the GUEST chooses. Unbounded, a guest
touching a1.example.com ... a100000.example.com grows the status file without
limit and, through `libexec/workload-exporter`, produces a Prometheus
cardinality explosion ON THE HOST -- a failure outside the workload that caused
it. So each map holds at most `top_n` named keys and everything else lands in
one `(other)` bucket.

`(other)` counts EVENTS, not hosts. §11 imagines it reading "and 41,882 more
hosts", and that number cannot be produced by a bounded structure: knowing how
many DISTINCT hosts overflowed means remembering which ones did, which is the
unbounded set the bound exists to avoid. An exact distinct count and a bound are
not both available here, and the bound is the one that protects the host.

Named keys are FIRST-SEEN, not busiest. Busiest-N is the more useful report and
needs full counts to compute, which is the same unbounded map again. The
consequence is worth stating because it is adversarial: a guest can fill all
`top_n` slots with cheap names and push its real traffic into `(other)`. That
does not hide the traffic -- `(other)` climbing IS the signal, and the totals
beside these maps are exact -- but it does mean the per-host detail is a
convenience for an operator reading a healthy workload, and never the evidence
on which a compromised one is judged.

    WHY THIS IS NEEDED AT ALL

    /run/workload-vm/<name> is the VM service's RuntimeDirectory, declared
    RuntimeDirectoryPreserve=yes so that a restart does not yank the qmp,
    console and virtiofs sockets out from under a sidecar. The consequence for
    these files is that they OUTLIVE the instance that wrote them.

    Both producers are socket-activated: the inspector starts on the guest's
    first dial, the responder on its first query. So between a VM start and the
    guest's first outbound anything, the previous instance's file is the one on
    disk -- and it reads as this instance's, with counters for traffic that
    happened before the reboot. `written_at` does not disambiguate it: a file
    from a previous boot and a file from a process that has been idle since
    that moment look identical, because they are the same file.

    Removed at arm time rather than at stop, because a stop is not guaranteed to
    run -- a host that loses power, or a service killed hard, leaves the file
    either way. Arming happens on every start by definition.

    Tolerant of everything: a missing file is the normal case on a first start,
    and a diagnostic that could not be cleared must never fail a VM start.

    `written_at` is not decoration. §11 makes the ABSENCE of a status file mean
    "this process has never served anything", which is the healthy state of a
    freshly started workload -- so a stale timestamp is the only way to tell a
    process that died from one that is quietly idle. Both look identical from
    the file's existence alone.

    Failures are swallowed by the CALLER, not here: a status write that cannot
    land must never take down a listener that is otherwise serving the guest
