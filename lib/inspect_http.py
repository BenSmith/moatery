inspect_http: authorise every request on a connection, and relay the ones
that pass.

Per REQUEST, not per connection. One connection carries many requests, each
free to name a different host, so a decision taken once at the front of it
would authorise everything behind the first name -- and the framing that
says where one request ends is written by the guest. Every refusal in
`lib/http_framing.py` exists because the alternative is a request the guest
smuggled past the authorisation of the one in front of it; `lib/http_target.py`
is why the target is normalised before anything here acts on it, and
`lib/http_request.py` is the head as this module sees it.

Two callers, one loop. The cleartext plane (port 80) enters at
serve_cleartext with the accepted socket; a terminated TLS connection enters
at serve_one_request with the decrypted one. The allowlist means the same
thing on both only because it is this loop that applies it on both.

Every function takes the workload's Inspection (lib/inspect_scope.py) first:
the policy the request is matched against, the counters and record it lands
in, the upstream pool it is sent down, and the log.
