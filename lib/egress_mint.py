"""
egress_mint — minting a workload's egress CA once, and the leaf certificates
its inspector presents.

The back half of bump-then-403. The inspector reads a name out of a ClientHello
without answering it, decides what the name deserves, and then -- for both
dispositions -- completes the handshake with a certificate this workload's own
CA signed, because a guest that gets a certificate ERROR learns nothing, while
a guest that gets a clean TLS session and a `403` knows it was answered, and
by the host it asked for, rather than cut off.

WHAT IS IN HERE AND WHY IT IS THREE THINGS RATHER THAN ONE

Minting is a subprocess (~20 ms, against ~0.1 ms in-process -- but `lib/`
has no third-party dependencies and stdlib cannot sign a certificate, so
`openssl` it is). That cost is what shapes everything else:

- A WORKING-SET CACHE, persisted, so a guest's usual hosts cost one mint each
  ever, not one per connection and not one per listener restart.
- A SEPARATE DENIAL-ONLY CACHE, so a guest hammering invented names cannot
  evict the working set that its legitimate traffic depends on. Two bounded
  LRUs, never one shared one -- with a shared cache, "flood the cache" is a
  denial of service against the workload's real destinations, spelled in
  ordinary traffic.
- A TOKEN BUCKET over all minting, because a cache miss is
  attacker-reachable by construction: the guest picks the names.

WHAT IS NOT VIABLE, RECORDED BECAUSE IT IS THE OBVIOUS FIRST IDEA

One shared certificate for every denial, minted once. The client validates the
SAN against the name it asked for and aborts on mismatch, so the guest gets a
certificate error instead of the `403` -- which is the entire benefit
bump-then-403 exists to buy. The denials must each be minted for their own
name, which is why they need a cache and a bucket of their own rather than a
constant.
