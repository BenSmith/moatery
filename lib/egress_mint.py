"""
egress_mint — minting leaf certificates for a filtered VM's egress inspector.

The back half of bump-then-403. The inspector reads a name out of a ClientHello
without answering it, decides what the name deserves, and then -- for both
dispositions -- completes the handshake with a certificate this workload's own
CA signed, because a guest that gets a certificate ERROR learns nothing, while a
guest that gets a clean TLS session and a `403` learns exactly which host was
refused and why.

WHAT IS IN HERE AND WHY IT IS THREE THINGS RATHER THAN ONE

Minting is a subprocess (~20 ms, against ~0.1 ms in-process -- but `lib/` has no
third-party dependencies and stdlib cannot sign a certificate, so `openssl` it
is; tests/test_stdlib_only.py enforces the constraint). That cost is what shapes
everything else:

- A WORKING-SET CACHE, persisted, so a guest's usual hosts cost one mint each
  ever, not one per connection and not one per listener restart.
- A SEPARATE DENIAL-ONLY CACHE, so a guest hammering invented names cannot
  evict the working set that its legitimate traffic depends on. Two bounded
  LRUs, never one shared one -- with a shared cache, "flood the cache" is a
  denial of service against the workload's real destinations, spelled in
  ordinary traffic.
- A TOKEN BUCKET over all minting, because a cache miss is attacker-reachable by
  construction: the guest picks the names.

WHAT IS NOT VIABLE, RECORDED BECAUSE IT IS THE OBVIOUS FIRST IDEA

One shared certificate for every denial, minted once. The client validates the
SAN against the name it asked for and aborts on mismatch, so the guest gets a
certificate error instead of the `403` -- which is the entire benefit
bump-then-403 exists to buy. The denials must each be minted for their own name,
which is why they need a cache and a bucket of their own rather than a constant.

# flood can delete a certificate out from under a handshake that was about to
# use it. With N connection slots, N distinct names can be checked out at once,
# and only the N+1'th insert can evict something nobody holds.
#
# This was 128, which is exactly workload-inspect-listener's MAX_CONNECTIONS
# and therefore exactly one entry short of the invariant: 128 concurrent
# denials for distinct names could evict the oldest of themselves. The failure

        this is the only place the value has a producer, because this is what
        mints with it.

        `notAfter` is here for one reason: a ten-year validity is invisible
        until something prints the date it ends on. Distant is not the same as
        safe, and an operator who can see 2036 can decide whether that is what
        they meant.

        Read once and remembered. The CA does not rotate -- decision 4 of ADR
        008 -- so re-reading it per status write would be a syscall per tick to
        confirm a constant. Every failure degrades to None rather than raising:
        this runs on the status path, and a status file is never worth a
        connection.
