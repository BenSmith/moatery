http_target: what a request target and an authority NAME, in one canonical form.

The request target the inspect listener acts on IS normalised here --
percent-decoding, dot-segment resolution, duplicate-slash collapsing -- and
the normalised form is what goes upstream. Normalisation is not a service
to the `paths` matcher; it is the claim that the string the listener acts on
and the string the origin acts on are the same string. A matcher reading a
different path from the one being fetched is a traversal, so the claim has to
hold whether or not any policy names a path. See normalise_path for what is
normalised, what is deliberately not (the query, `;params`, a trailing `/`),
and why each.

The same applies to the two other places a guest names a destination: the
authority (`Host`, or an absolute-form target) and a redirect's `Location`.
Each is reduced to the one name the policy is matched against, for the plane
the request arrived on -- `Scheme` says which port that plane is, so that
`Host: example.com:443` is the ordinary spelling on one and misdirected on
the other.
